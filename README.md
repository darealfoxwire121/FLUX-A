*OpenCV solutions for Roblox*

## **How does it work?**

This project uses **OpenCV** to recognize roblox characters and other objects, and use the information gathered to produce a desired output. It (will) consist of of multiple utilities to provide the roblox needs, including but not limited to:

- [ ] Roblox Auto_Aim  
- [ ] Roblox Lane_Detection
- [ ] Ro-Beats AutoPlay (Maybe)

*(Please regard the matter that I will not be working on this each second of the day as I will be completing my tasks of every-day life. If I have accomplished a checkpoint with this project, you will be able to see the change on my Github post, it might be noticeable in the project tab or in the README.md file itself).*
