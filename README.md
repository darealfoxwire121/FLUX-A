# **CV-Roblox**

*OpenCV solutions for Roblox*

## **How does it work?**

This project uses **OpenCV** to recognize roblox characters and other object, and use the information gathered to produce a desired output.  
It (will) consist of of multiple utilities to provide the roblox needs, including but not limited to:

- [ ] Roblox Auto-Aim  
- [ ] Roblox Auto-Drive

## **When will it be finished?**

Whenever I have completed stages to this project I will change this part of the ReadMe, so just wait and look for changes *here*.
